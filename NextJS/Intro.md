# Next.js

Allows to build FULLSTACK app with React.js

- FullStack Apps (Next.js blends frontend + backend in same project).
    
    Advantage - Frontend and backend tasks are part of the same project
    
- FileSystem based Routing -
    - Routes are configured via the filesystem (folders + files)
    - Advantage - No code-based configuration or extra packages for routing are required.

    - Advantage - The finished HTML page (including content) is sent to the client (great for SEO)
